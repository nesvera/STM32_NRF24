# STM32_NRF24
This is a STM32 library for the nRF24L01 Wireless Transceiver.

This library is based on RF24 library for Arduino and http://stm32f4-discovery.net/2014/06/library-17-nrf24l01-stm32f4xx/ .

# Developed and tested on STM32F103C8T6 using Keil uVision5 IDE and STM32CubeMX.

There are some example of how to use the library. There are compatible codes for Arduino of which example.

Some bugs may apper!

To do list:
* Write some extra functions
* Improve SPI initialization
* Interrupt funtions
* Expand to others families of STM32

Version 1*10^0.0
